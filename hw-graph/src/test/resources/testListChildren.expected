# Test ListChildren
# Testing to see if listChildren can list the children of given node

# Create a graph
create graph newGraph

# Add all parent and child nodes
added node parent to newGraph
added node child1 to newGraph
added node child2 to newGraph
added node child3 to newGraph

# Add edges between parent and all child nodes
added edge e1 from parent to child1 in newGraph
added edge e2 from parent to child2 in newGraph
added edge e3 from parent to child3 in newGraph

# List the children of the parent node
the children of parent in newGraph are: child1(e1) child2(e2) child3(e3)
