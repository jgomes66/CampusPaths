# Test Two Edges Between Same Nodes
# Testing to see if we can add two edges with different labels to the same two nodes

# Create a graph
CreateGraph newGraph

# Add two nodes to graph
AddNode newGraph node1
AddNode newGraph node2

# Add two edges with node1 as parent and node2 as child for both
AddEdge newGraph node1 node2 e1
AddEdge newGraph node1 node2 e2

# Print the outgoing edges from node1
ListChildren node1 from newGraph
