# Test Adding One Edge Between Two Nodes
# Testing to see if we can add an edge between two nodes

# Create a graph
created graph newGraph

# Add two nodes to our graph
added node node1 to newGraph
added node node2 to newGraph

# Add edge connecting node1 and node2
added edge e1 from node1 to node2 in newGraph

# Print nodes in graph and outgoing edges of node1
newGraph contains: node1 node2
The children of node1 in newGraph are: node2(e1)
