# Test Edge to Same Node
# Testing to see if node can have an edge to itself

# Create a graph
create graph newGraph

# Add a node
added node node1 to newGraph

# Add an edge to node and itself
added edge e1 from node1 to node1 in newGraph

# List children of node1
The children of node1 in newGraph are: node1(e1)
