# Test Adding One Edge Between Two Nodes
# Testing to see if we can add an edge between two nodes

# Create a graph

# Add two nodes to our graph
AddNode newGraph node1
AddNode newGraph node2

# Add edge connecting node1 and node2
AddEdge newGraph node1 node2 e1

# Print nodes in graph and outgoing edges of node1
