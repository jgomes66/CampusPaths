1. Why did Fibonacci fail the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException< test? What (if anything) did
you have to do to fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

Fibonacci failed the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException test because the orignal code throws an ThrowsIllegalArgumentException if
n <= 0. This is incorrect because in the Fibonacci sequence, the first number is in fact 0. Therefore, we should not throw an IllegalArgumentException because 0 is a valid number, so I had to change n <= 0 to n < 0.

2. Why did Fibonacci fail the testBaseCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to fix
it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

Fibonacci failed the testBaseCase because similar to my previous answer, 0 is a valid number in the Fibonacci sequence so the program should have returned 1 instead of throwing the IllegalArgumentException. When I fixed the first error, this error was also automatically fixed. 



3.Why did Fibonacci fail the testInductiveCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to
fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

Fibonacci failed the testInductiveCase because in the else if branch, n <= 2 should be changed to n < 2 because the only base cases should be 1 and 0 because 1 is the only repeated integer in the sequence. In the orignal code if n was 2, we would simply return 1 instead of going into the recursive call. There was another issue in the recursive call because the Fibonacci sequence is the sum of the 2 previous numbers. In the orignal code, we were calculating the difference, so I had to change the the return statemtn to calculate the sum rather than the difference.
